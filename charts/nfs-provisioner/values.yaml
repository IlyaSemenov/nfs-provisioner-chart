# There are serveral modes under which the nfs-provisioner logic can run.
#
# hostPath (default):
#   A hostPath volume mounts a file or directory from the host nodeâ€™s filesystem into your pod
#   https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#hostpath
#   Available Settings:
#     - path: /directory/location/on/host (defaults to /srv/nfs-provisioner)
#
# tmpFs:
#   mount a tmpfs (RAM-backed filesystem) instead of using the host node's storage
#   or a PVC. This is very fast and very volatile, but might be useful for things
#   like caches and temporary workspaces.
#   Available Settings:
#     none
#
# emptyDir:
#   An emptyDir volume is first created when a Pod is assigned to a Node, and
#   exists as long as that Pod is running on that node.
#   https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir
#   Available Settings:
#     none
#
# pvc:
#   Make a Persistent Volume Claim for the nfs-provisioner.
#   https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/
#   Available Settings:
#     - storageSize: 5Gi (defaults to 1Gi)
provisionerVolume:
  mode: "hostPath"
  settings: {}
  #   - foo: bar (see available settings for your mode above)
